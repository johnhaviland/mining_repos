# mining_repos

The code in the Jupyter Notebook can be slightly edited to analyze most GitHub repositories.

To run:

* Download notebook file/take code from within the notebook. You don't need to download the other files as they will be created when the code is run.
  
* Ensure all the necessary Python libraries are installed into your current Python kernel by running the following command into your terminal:

  pip install requests pandas matplotlib seaborn wordcloud

* Enter your personal OpenAI API key and GitHub tokens into the code where it says to.

* Run all cells (or file if running in Python)
